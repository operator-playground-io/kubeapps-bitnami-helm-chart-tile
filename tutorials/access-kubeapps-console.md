### Access WordPress Console


To obtain the application URL, wait until the pods are running.


Your WordPress site can be accessed through the following DNS name from within your cluster:

```
 wordpress.wordpress.svc.cluster.local (port 80)
```

To access your WordPress site and Dashboard from outside the cluster follow the steps below:


1. Get the WordPress URL by running below commands:


```execute
 export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace wordpress -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services wordpress)
 export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace wordpress -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
```


2. Open a browser and access WordPress Site using the obtained URL by executing below command:

```execute
echo "WordPress URL: http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/"
```
You should see your WordPress site with the custom theme that you have included in your image already activated.
